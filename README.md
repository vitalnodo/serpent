# Serpent

Implementation of the Serpent cryptographic symmetric encryption algorithm 
that took second place in the AES contest.

However, it is necessary to make different secure encryption modes and probably in general to turn the written closer to the AES (Rijndael) algorithm in the standard library.

To make sure it works as expected just
